## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This can be particularly useful in scenarios such as ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations in public spaces.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of people with and without face masks. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
  - Training Set: Contains images for training the model.
  - Testing Set: Contains images for evaluating the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
