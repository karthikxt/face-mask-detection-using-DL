## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This can be particularly useful in scenarios such as ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations in public spaces.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of people with and without face masks. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
  - Training Set: Contains images for training the model.
  - Testing Set: Contains images for evaluating the model's performance.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

  - Python 3.x
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

    pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the project:

1.Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-mask-detection.git
    cd face-mask-detection

2.Open Google Colab:
Go to Google Colab and upload the face_mask_detection.ipynb notebook.

3.Upload Dataset:
Ensure that the dataset is uploaded to your Google Colab environment. You can use the Colab file uploader to do this.

4.Run the Notebook:
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
The trained model is evaluated on the testing set to determine its accuracy and performance. The results include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
